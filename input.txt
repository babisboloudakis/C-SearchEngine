0   And we were bold
1    Over the world
2 We were flying through the satellites
3 We had ahold
4 Of the lightning strikes
5 When we should have been afraid of heights
6 And I was trying just to get you
7 And now I'm dying to forget you
8 Cause I knew I couldn't catch you
9 So I left the sky
10 And I fell behind
11 We were one in the same
12 Running like moths to the flame
13 You'd hang on every word I'd say
14 But now they only ricochet
15 We were falling away
16 You left me with a bittersweet taste
17 But when I send my heart your way
18 It bounces off the walls you made
19 Ricochet
20 If I was whole
21 I'd turn right now
22 I'd forget it and just walk away
23 Cause I've been told
24 That I'm dragging it out
25 But I've been dying just to see your face
26 And all I wanted was to say "goodbye"
27 Into the fortress that you're stuck behind
28 And in the silence now I realize
29 That after all I built the wall
30 We were one in the same
31 Running like moths to the flame
32 You'd hang on every word I'd say
33 But now they only ricochet
34 You were falling away
35 You left me with a bittersweet taste
36 But when I send my heart your way
37 It bounces off the walls you made
38 Ricochet
